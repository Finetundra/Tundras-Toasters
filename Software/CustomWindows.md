# The Toasty Guide to Customizing Windows

This page provides various options for customizing Microsoft Windows, from desktop shell replacements, to smaller utilities for things like changing keyboard commands. If you are looking to customize Windows and you're not afraid to break things, you're in the right place. 

## Windows Desktop Shells 

The native Windows desktop shell is Microsoft Windows Explorer (explorer.exe) which provides a taskbar (or panel), file manager, and start menu. Older shells simply replaced Explorer, however since some newer settings are tied to Explorer running, most newer shells will require Explorer to be running. Changing your desktop shell can severely break desktop functionality and could also prevent user login. Proceed with caution. 

### Cairo Shell: 

[A macOS/GNOME 2 like shell with a menu panel and dock/taskbar. Most complete, modern, replacement shell.](https://github.com/cairoshell/cairoshell)

### Retrobar: 

[Not a complete shell, replaces the Windows taskbar](https://github.com/dremin/RetroBar)

### xoblite: 

[A derivative of Blackbox for Windows, one of the only maintained ones.](https://xoblite.net/docs/)

### bbZero: 

[Another derivative of Blackbox for Windows, however is much older and has some issues. If the bbLeanSkin module is loaded, will conflict with anti-cheat solutions such as BattlEye and EasyAntiCheat. As all original builds have vanished, a build will be linked from this repo.](https://github.com/Finetundra/Tundras-Toasters/tree/master/Software)


## Windows GUI tweaks and customization

Everything in this section is about changing the existing UI without replacing it or masking it entirely. Like the previous section, these changes can and will break your Windows install. Again, proceed with caution 

### WinAero Tweaker: 

[A utility that provides multiple tweaks for modifying the behaviour of Windows Explorer and several other components of Windows](https://winaero.com/downloads/winaerotweaker.zip)

### SecureUXThemePatcher: 

[This utility patches parts of Windows to allow the use of third party created themes for Windows Explorer. Only works for Windows 8.1 and up. Windows 7 and lower will not be covered here.](https://github.com/namazso/SecureUxTheme)

### OpenShell: 

[Replaces the Start Menu with options for several older styles.](https://github.com/Open-Shell/Open-Shell-Menu)

### StarDock WindowBlinds: 

[Proprietary tool for applying "skins" that change the style of window frames and the taskbar. Has conflicts with Chromium derived applications like Google Chrome and Discord.](https://www.stardock.com/products/windowblinds/)

### StarDock Curtains: 

[Similar to WindowBlinds, only changes some aesthetic elements of window frames, rather than modifying Win32 elements. Conflicts with Chromium based applications such as Google Chrome and Discord.](https://www.stardock.com/products/windowblinds/)

### Wallpaper Engine: 

[JS based utility for custom animated wallpapers.](https://www.wallpaperengine.io/en)
